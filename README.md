Repo for my Ludum Dare 40 Entry

This repo will be updated at each hour I am working on the project. An Inital Commit includes a Unity Project with a few settings to make getting going a little easier.


# Game Information
The More You Have the Worse It Is

The Papers
You are a hoarder of newspapers. Everyday you recieve a thing of papers, each day the amount increases as your addiction grows. Inside your room you have several furniture items. You have to leave your bed open to sleep each night, and your door open to recieve your next days worth of papers. You also have a ladder that allows you to reach the ceiling. The goal is to have as many newspapers as possible in your house while still being able to sleep each night. You can only lift so many papers at a time, and if a stack is to hight and you bump into it it could fall over. Throughout the room there are various other furniture objects to cause more chaos. Occasionally things within your house will break. You must then call someone to fix it, but the worker has to be able to access the broken item. Examples of things that could break are light (dim lighting when trying to work), the heater (you start to slowly freeze to death until you can get it fixed), and a window (it will rain and destroy all the newspaper near the window, this won't end the game but will remove points). If papers are to close to the heater they will start a fire and your papers will start to burn away, there is a fire extinguisher.

There is no win, just don't lose. You can lose by knocking over a stack, or not being able to sleep one night.

Within this commit I outline my basic plans for the game. This is all I am doing for tonight as I worked all day, tomorrow morning I will start on building out the basic of the game, newspaper manipulation and sleeping.
